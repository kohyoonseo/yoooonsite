                CONNECT ONE <br> <br> (RED) and Fiat: a unique partnership that fights health emergencies and, more generally, pandemics with every purchase of a (600)RED, creating the most ethical and relevant series. (RED) is an organization that fights global health emergencies like AIDS and COVID: every time you buy a (RED) product, your purchase triggers a donation to the Global Fund to support a range of prevention, treatment, counselling, testing, education and care services to the communities most in need. That’s why we’ve proudly joined this experience and created the new (600)RED: to let you be part of it. Fiat, Jeep and RAM have committed, through the partnership with (RED), and through it, to donate a minimum of 4 million dollars to The Global Fund between 2021 and 2023 to help fight health emergencies like COVID-19 and AIDS. Each (FIAT)RED vehicle is a (RED) Product and it is part of this commitment.
